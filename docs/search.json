Problem-solving skills and a good knowledge of your own computer OS structure and function will definitely be useful.\nThis course does not teach you system administration skills and you should know how to read help files and software guides, as well as retrieve information on-line. Should a student not have a portable computer, all code, demonstrations, and class slides will be uploaded on this website and are available for practice on a desktop computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNote that the code has been written on a Unix-based systems (macOS).

The course offers an overview of the different types of marking and tracking of wildlife, and promotes an understanding of their best ways of use in relation to the specific field of application. Through the review of the scientific literature and the discussion of the different animal monitoring techniques, the course participants will develop the necessary critical skills for understanding the various problems related to the acquisition and organization of time series of data for animal tracking."

    "text": "Molecular tags\nFrom the USGS website:\n\nMolecular tagging is a new application of molecular genetic techniques to traditional mark-recapture methodology designed to address situations where traditional methods fail. In such studies, non-invasively collected samples (such as feces, feathers, or fur) are used as a source of DNA that is then genotyped at multiple loci such that each individual animal can be uniquely identified. Thus, each individual’s DNA represents a unique tag analogous to a band or other mark used in traditional mark-recapture studies.\n\n\n\n\n\nSelected species and locations for which genetic tagging for demographic insights into population density, growth rates, direct measures of connectivity, or human–wildlife conflict has been successfully applied. Projects using genetic tagging for these demographic insights have been conducted on every continent, except Antarctica, and have sampled a variety of taxa, using many different sources of DNA, but are biased toward mid-large sized mobile mammals. After Lamb et al. (2019)\n\n\n\n\n\nTelemetry study\nSmall devices transmitting specific radio frequencies have been, and still are, widely used to track animals. Telemetry (𝛕𝛈𝛌𝛆 = far, 𝛍𝛆𝛕𝛒𝛐𝛎 = measurement) is a technique that allows to retrieve real time data and information using an array of wireless data transfer protocols.\n\n\n\n\n\nBarrell transmitter implanted in a female Turks and Caicos Rainbow Boa (Chilabothrus chrysogaster).
